       "{'text': 'In addition to the genotyping per sample, we wanted to ensure for this study that SNP positions examined were adequately covered across all samples. This is a concern, because many variant calling methods in high-throughput sequencing are ambiguous when not reporting a variant as to whether there was not enough coverage to genotype, or if there was a legitimate homozygous reference genotype. To discern such cases, each BigY sample was given a “confidence” region list determined by genotype quality scores for each base. The genotype quality is computed as the probability that the genotype is correct, according to a phred score. This probability is derived from AEngine’s proprietary statistical model considering characteristics of read coverage, individual read mapping qualities, and base sequencing quality scored by the HiSeq. A base position is appended to the confidence regions for that sample if its genotype quality score is above 3.02. Thus, if there is no variant occurring at a base within confidence intervals for a sample, it can be assumed that the sample is reference genotype at that position. Variant calls were produced and handled as Variant Call Format (VCF) files, according to the established field standards (http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.1.pdf). To this effect, the intersection of confident regions covered by the 20 samples studied was also recorded, and can be found within the Supplementary Data. More details on the BigY capture sequencing method are available at https://www.familytreedna.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BIG_Y_WhitePager.pdf, which features the methods and the capture probe list and target regions.',\n",
